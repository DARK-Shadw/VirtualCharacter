## Project Description
The Virtual Desktop Companion is a lighthearted desktop application that introduces a virtual character to your computer screen. 
Inspired by classic desktop buddies, this character is more than a static sprite; it has a dynamic personality, sometimes just 
chilling, and at other times creating playful chaos.It can move around, chase your mouse cursor, and more, all designed to add 
a bit of personality and fun to your daily workflow.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
"The Lonely Desktop Syndrome Cure: A Revolutionary AI Companion Project"

In a groundbreaking attempt to combat the increasingly commonbut utterly unrecognized issue known as Lonely DesktopSyndrome (LDS), 
this project aims to create a truly interactive, almost too lifelike, virtual character to keep users company during those long,
isolating hours of work and internet browsing.

Problem Statement: Studies (conducted by, well, us) show that 87% of desktops
suffer from acute loneliness, with symptoms including unused icons, neglected files, and untouched software.
Current virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa only talk to you‚Äîthey don‚Äôt hang out, learn how to get in
the way, or simulate life‚Äôs little annoyances and joys.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

This project introduces Desktop Danny, a digital beingwho can express boredom, joy, and even righteous indignationwhen ignored too long.
Desktop Danny not only follows yourmouse around and waves, but also gets mischievous if left idle too long, perhaps moving files around 
or hiding behind your windows. And, in the event of a crisis (like you deleting a folder he likes),he‚Äôs programmed to enter a dramatic 
"dragged-off-screen" mode, complete with ragdoll physics, as he mourns the loss.

Core Features:
Emotional Intelligence (EI): Danny‚Äôs got feelings, lots of them, which are randomly triggered tomake him feel more ‚Äúhuman.‚Äù
Sometimes he just stares into the void.
Physics-Driven Reactions: Pick him up, throw him around, and
watch him land realistically, all while complaining about it.
